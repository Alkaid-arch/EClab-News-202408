summary = "这篇文章探讨了文化差异如何影响对虚伪的归因，特别是在东亚和西方文化中，人们如何评价与态度或行为不一致的情况。研究发现，与西方人相比，东亚人更容易将虚伪归因于与他人有社会联系的人的行为，虚伪可能比之前认为的更具灵活性，并且这种行为在不同文化背景下可能有不同的解释和结果。" 
abstract = "Humans worldwide have long deplored hypocrisy, a concept that has been mentioned in texts dating back 100–1,000 years (e.g., the Analects of Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, the Bible, and the Qur’an). However, what influences the extent of hypocrisy attribution or counts as hypocrisy may differ as a function of culture. Previous studies have shown that Westerners attribute greater hypocrisy for within-person attitude–behavior inconsistency than East Asians. Building on this, we predict that East Asians’ (vs. Westerners’) hypocrisy attribution is more heavily influenced by social relationships. Consistent with past research, this can lead to greater leniency. However, as we show, this can also result in the novel finding we present that attributions of mild-to-moderate hypocrisy are made even when no explicit within-person attitude–behavior inconsistency is present. Across six experiments, we found that Koreans (vs. participants from the United States) attributed more hypocrisy to attitude-contradicting behavior when the person enacting the behavior was not the person who stated the attitude but was someone who shared social bonds with that person (i.e., cross-person, within-relationship attitude–behavior inconsistency; “relational hypocrisy”). Specifically, Koreans attributed more hypocrisy than Americans when a child’s behavior contradicted their parent’s views (Experiments 1a and 1b) or when attitude-contradicting behavior was enacted by the child of a close friend (Experiment 2). Experiments 3–5 replicated the findings from Experiments 1–2 using additional social contexts (e.g., a spousal relationship). Supplementary analyses showed that differences in hypocrisy attribution between Americans and Koreans were mediated by cultural differences in their perceptions of shared responsibility within relationships"

summary = "这篇文章探讨了领导者在面对质疑性问题时用笑声回应的效果，其中发现领导者的笑声可能会增强或削弱他们在见证者眼中的温暖感和领导效能，具体取决于笑声是否与提问者共享，这种效应在提问者提出关键性问题时更为显著。" 
abstract = '''Leaders are frequently put in the difficult position of repudiating critical questions in front of their followers. To help manage this situation, leaders sometimes express laughter in the hopes that it will “lubricate” their interaction and reduce perceptions that they are aggressive or confrontational with the critical questioner. Ironically, leaders’ laughter may backfire by diminishing their apparent friendliness and approachability in the eyes of the witnessing followers. In this article, we employ an emotional aperture perspective to examine two seemingly contradictory theoretical perspectives regarding the potential impact of laughter on the witnessing followers’ perception of a leader’s warmth and effectiveness. Findings from nine studies across 2,012 adults show that leader laughter—even expressed briefly—bolsters or damages leader effectiveness depending on one important contingency: whether the leader’s laughter is shared by the questioner. Unshared laughter reduces leader effectivenessby undermining leaders' apparent warmth, while shared laughter increases leader effectiveness by enhancing leaders’ apparent warmth. We discuss implications for the literature on emotion expression, leadership events, and leader perception and influence.'''
